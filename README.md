# Human-Biometric-Monitoring-System-using-ESP32-NodeMCU
A biometric system built using NodeMCU - ESP32 to monitor the body temperature and the pulse rate using LM35 Temperature Sensor and AD8232 ECG Heart Tracker. The data is logged into the Blynk IoT Cloud Platform.

### 1. AD 8232 ECG Tracker

   NodeMCU is a low-cost open source IoT platform. It initially included firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which was based on the ESP-12 module. Later, support for the ESP32 32-bit MCU was added. We have used the NodeMCU version 1.0 which uses ESP-12E support.
